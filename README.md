🌤️ Destination Weather

📝 Project Description
Destination Weather is a web application that helps users find travel destinations with weather conditions that match their desired temperature. The user enters a temperature in Fahrenheit, and the app suggests a city with the closest matching weather. The app also provides a "More Info" button to display detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

This project uses a two-page structure:

Home Page (index.html): Allows users to input their desired temperature.
Details Page (details.html): Displays detailed weather information for the suggested destination.

🚀 How It Works
The user enters a temperature in Fahrenheit.
The app sends a POST request to the server to find the closest matching city from a list.
The result is displayed on the screen, showing the city name and its current temperature.
The user can click the "More Info" button to get additional weather details for the selected city.

⚙️ Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: For front-end structure and styling.
JavaScript: For handling user interactions and API requests.
Python (Flask): As the back-end framework to manage requests and serve data.
OpenWeatherMap API: To fetch live weather data for cities.
